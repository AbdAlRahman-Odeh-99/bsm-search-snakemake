Waiting at most 5 seconds for missing files.
Terminating processes on user request, this might take some time.
MissingOutputException in line 42 of /home/abd/Desktop/Work/Snakemake/bsm-search-snakemake/Snakefile:
Missing files after 5 seconds:
/home/abd/Desktop/Work/Snakemake/bsm-search-snakemake/data/bsm-search/mc1.root
This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait.
